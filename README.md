# UD is a website that focused on sharing knowledge, mainly about technology and contain my latest projects.

## UD is my experimentation corner because there I apply my new knowledge, when I learn something I try to implement here, for example:

- Typescript.

- MongoDB.

- SEO.

- Atomic Design.

- Styled Components.

- SSR (Server Side Render).

- GitHub actions.

- Facebook Pixel.

- PWA.

- Polyfills usage.

- Web optimization.

## This project began like a design system and eventually try to add a blog using:

- Stylus
- Pug
- Travis CI
- GitHub pages

But when I began to learn about React the project were archived, and I begin from 0.

I tried to implement my design system, but I realized I had no portfolio, so I stop to create them. At this moment my design system continue archived, but I still take account some rules:

1. Accessibility

Every product must be able to be used by anyone, so it must be:

- Perceptible: All the elements that compose it must be able to be easily visualized.
- Operable: The product must be easy to use.
- Understanding: Anyone must understand what he is doing.
- Robust: The product must be supported by accessibility programs.

2. Consistency

All the elements must be familiar to people, seeking that the learning curve of the product is short.

3. Reusability

All the elements that make up the product must be able to be reused at any time.

4. Compatibility

The product must be able to be viewed on most devices (the existing browsers)

5. Optimization

All items in the product should consume the least amount of user resources

## At this moment the project contains:

- [My portfolio](https://ulisessg.com/)
- [My personal blog](https://ulisessg.com/blog)
- [A page where I share gists (code pieces)](https://ulisessg.com/gist)

### Front End:
- Next.js
- React.
- Typescript.
- Styled Components
- Firebase.
- NVDA (screen reader).
- Workbox

### CI/CD:
- GitHub Actions, where I test:
    - Accessibility, performance, SEO and best practices using LHCI (Google Lighthouse)
    - Husky to enforce ESLINT rules

### Back End:
- Express.js.
- Typescript.
- MongoDB.
- Vercel.
